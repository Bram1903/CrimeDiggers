# CrimeDiggers

This repository contains my solutions to various Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges created by
the [Dutch Police Force (#CRIMEDIGGERS)](https://www.crimediggers.nl/). These challenges are part of an initiative to
recruit IT professionals by showcasing the exciting and technical aspects of digital forensics, geolocation,
and investigative work in cybersecurity.

The purpose of this repository is to document my solutions and provide a resource for others who are interested in
exploring these challenges or learning more about these fields.
